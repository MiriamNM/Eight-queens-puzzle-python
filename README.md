# Eight Queens Puzzle API
[The eight queens puzzle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight_queens_puzzle) The eight queens puzzle is the problem of placing eight chess queens on an 8Ã—8 chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other; thus, a solution requires that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal. There are 92 solutions. The problem was first posed in the mid-19th century. In the modern era, it is often used as an example problem for various computer programming techniques. 

## Challenges
- Develop the 8 queens algorithm in python, the project uses Python version 3.11.
- Use FastApi to build the api.
- Use ORM as flyway and make migrations.
- Store the solutions in postgres

## Next steps
- Return answers to solutions with pagination

## Requirements
- Docker y Docker Compose
- python
- venv
- postman 
- visual studio code

### Commands to: create and activate python environment and install dependencies
   ```bash
   # create python environment
   make create-venv

   # activate python environment
   source venv/bin/activate

   # disable python environment
   deactivate

   # install dependencies
   make install
   ```

9. Makefile commands for: build, start, stop, restart, status, rebuild, logs, and bash

   ```bash
      # To ensure all dependencies are correctly installed, especially uvicorn and fastapi.
      # Before doing make test run this command: export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/Users/mirichi/Documents/dev/Eight-queens-puzzle-python/src
      make test-requirements

      # Start services with Docker Compose
      make up

      # Stop services
      make down

      # Rebuild the services and remove volumes and images
      make rebuild

      # Check the status of services
      make status

      # Follow logs from services
      make logs

      # Access the database
      make queens

      # Run migrations
      make migrate

      # Undo the last migration
      make undo
   ```
