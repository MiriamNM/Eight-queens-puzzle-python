# Eight Queens Puzzle API
[The eight queens puzzle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight_queens_puzzle) The eight queens puzzle is the problem of placing eight chess queens on an 8Ã—8 chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other; thus, a solution requires that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal. There are 92 solutions. The problem was first posed in the mid-19th century. In the modern era, it is often used as an example problem for various computer programming techniques. 

## Challenges
- Develop the 8 queens algorithm in python, the project uses Python version 3.11.
- Use FastApi to build the api.
- Use ORM as flyway and make migrations.
- Store the solutions in postgres

## Next steps
- Implement actions for the connection of postgres and flyway
- Return answers to solutions with pagination

## Requirements
- Docker y Docker Compose
- python
- venv
- postman 
- visual studio code

### Commands to: create and activate python environment and install dependencies
   ```bash
   # If you are using python 3.11
   # create python environment
   make create-venv

   # activate python environment
   source venv/bin/activate

   # disable python environment
   deactivate

   # install pip
   make pip

   # install dependencies
   make install
   ```

9. Makefile commands for: build, start, stop, restart, status, rebuild, logs, and bash

   ```bash
      # To ensure all dependencies are correctly installed, especially uvicorn and fastapi.
      # Before doing make test run this command: export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:$(pwd)/src
      make test-requirements

      # Build image
      make build

      # Start services with Docker Compose
      make up

      # Stop services
      make down

      # Delete volumes and images and rebuild the entire container
      make rebuild

      # Running tests with pytest
      make run-tests
   ```
10. Platforms to make http requests
   - Postman

11. Queens API
- To obtain the data [GET](http://localhost:8080/queens/)

- To create data [POST: http://localhost:8080/queens/](http://localhost:8080/queens/)
```bash
   {
      "n": 8,
      "context": {
         "email": "mir@mail.com"
      }
   }
 ```

 12. Instructions for Configuring `pre-commit`
This project uses [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) to automate the execution of Git hooks before making a commit. This ensures that quality tasks, such as code formatting, are performed before any changes are confirmed.
### Steps Description
1. **Install dependencies**: `pre-commit` is installed automatically along with other libraries when you run:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
2. Prepare changes: Add the modified files to the staging area using
   ```bash
      git add . 
      git add 'file'
3. Make the commit: Use the command to create a standardized commit message with Commitizen
   ```bash
      cz c 
      cz commit
4. Push the code: Send your changes to the remote repository using
   ```bash
      git push origin "branch"
- By following these steps, you ensure that commit messages follow a standard format and that the code passes quality checks before being pushed.
