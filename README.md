# Eight Queens Puzzle API
[The eight queens puzzle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight_queens_puzzle) The eight queens puzzle is the problem of placing eight chess queens on an 8Ã—8 chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other; thus, a solution requires that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal. There are 92 solutions. The problem was first posed in the mid-19th century. In the modern era, it is often used as an example problem for various computer programming techniques. 

## Challenges
- Develop the 8 queens algorithm in python, the project uses Python version 3.11.
- Use FastApi to build the api.
- Use ORM as flyway and make migrations.
- Store the solutions in postgres

## Next steps
- Return answers to solutions with pagination

## Requirements
- Docker y Docker Compose
- python
- venv
- postman 
- visual studio code
