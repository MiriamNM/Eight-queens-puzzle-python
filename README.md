# Eight Queens Puzzle API

[The eight queens puzzle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight_queens_puzzle) The eight queens puzzle is the problem of placing eight chess queens on an 8Ã—8 chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other; thus, a solution requires that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal. There are 92 solutions. The problem was first posed in the mid-19th century. In the modern era, it is often used as an example problem for various computer programming techniques.arquitectura hexagonal. 

## Challenges
- Develop the 8 queens algorithm in python.
- Use FastApi to build the api.
- Use ORM as flyway and make migrations.
Store the solutions in postgres

## Next steps
- Finish the backend where Flyway already works well.
- Implement the frontend.

## Requirements

- Docker y Docker Compose
- python
- venv
- postman 
- visual studio code

## Comandos

- Build: `make build`
- Rebuild: `make rebuild`
- Raise services: `make up`
- Run tests: `make test`

### Commands to: create and activate python environment and install dependencies

   ```bash
   # create python environment
   make create-venv

   # activate python environment
   source venv/bin/activate

   # disable python environment
   deactivate

   # install dependencies
   make install
   ```

9. Makefile commands for: build, start, stop, restart, status, rebuild, logs, and bash

   ```bash
   # compile the image
   make build

   # llift the container
   make start

   # stops the container
   make stop

   # restart the container
   make restart

   # shows the status of the container
   make status

   # stops, builds and starts the worker container
   make rebuild

   # mshow container logs
   make logs

   # Show database
   make queens

   ```
